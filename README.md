# data-analysis: Profit Forecasting
## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for my data analysis project. The project analyzes R&D, administration and marketing data, visualizes trends, and develops a profit forecasting model using Python and data science techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `datacleaning.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire data cleaning process.
- `datamodelling&eda`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire data modelling process, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization. 
- `data`: The csv file containing the data used in the project.

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the analysis, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
