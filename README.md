# data-analysis: Profit Forecasting
## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for my data analysis project. The project analyzes R&D, administration and marketing data, visualizes trends, and develops a profit forecasting model using Python and data science techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `datacleaning.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire data cleaning process.
- `datamodelling&eda.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire data modelling process, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization. 
- `data.csv`: The csv file containing the data used in the project.

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the analysis, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analysis-project.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
```
cd Profit_Forecasting_Data_Analysis
```
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook
   
```
jupyter notebook datacleaning.ipynb
jupyter notebook datamodelling&eda.ipynb
```

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to reproduce the data analysis process, including loading the dataset, cleaning the data and the datamodelling and eda
